This sample is a simple .NET C# desktop application that creates a new invoice in 
QuickBooks by calling qbXMLRP COM dll.
Standard .NET classes are used for formatting the qbXML request 
and parsing the qbXML response. 

Running the sample
------------------

Before running MCInvoiceAdd.exe, make sure that .NET runtime is installed on the machine, 
and QuickBooks is running with a company opened. 


Building the sample
------------------
Please install latest QBSDK.

Open MCInvoiceAdd.sln in Microsoft Visual Studio .NET and build the solution.
Interop.QBXMLRPLib.dll has been generated by Visual Studio, 
by adding a COM reference to qbXMLRP.dll.
