' Module: SyncCustomerListModule
'
' Description: This module contains the code which creates QBFC
'              messages, exchanges them with QuickBooks, interprets
'              the responses and loads information into form objects.
'
' Routines: OpenConnectionBeginSession
'             Opens a connection and begins a sesson with the
'             currently open company file.  If a company isn't open,
'             the routine will display a message and then exit the
'             program.
'
'           EndSessionCloseConnection
'             Calls EndSession and CloseConnection if the boolean
'             booSessionBegun is true.
'
'           GetCustomers
'             Send a CustomerQuery to QuickBooks.  Call FillCustomerListBox 
'             to fill in the list box.
'
'           FillCustomerListBox
'             Parses a CustomerQueryRet response and 
'             fills the Customer List Box with the FullName/ListID 
'             object for each Item.  The Customer's FullName is displayed in
'             list box.
'
'           SyncCustomerList
'             Calls the CompanyFileRestored, CheckDeletedCustomers and 
'             CheckModifiedCustomer functions to keep out Customer List
'             up to date
'
'           CompanyFileRestored
'             Calls the CompanyActivityQuery to determine if the company 
'             file has been restored since our last sync.  If the restore
'             has happened, we will requery all customers and fill in the
'             list box again by calling the GetCustomers function.
'
'           CheckDeletedCustomers
'             Calls the ListDeletedQuery to determine if any customers have
'             been deleted since the last time we sync'd our customer list
'             with QB.  If some customers have been deleted, we will find 
'             the customers in our list box and delete them.
'
'           CheckModifiedCustomer
'             Calls the CustomerQuery with a FromModifiedDate filter to 
'             determine which customer records have been modified since our 
'             last sync with QB.  If some customers have been deleted, we 
'             will find the customer in our list and update our list data
'             with the data from QB.
'
'           FoundCustomerInListBox
'             Loops thru the objects in the list box to see if we have a match.
